<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>This site is just bits and bobs about me which I think might be useful for others. Currently a second year physics undergrad, but am interested in educational access work and software as well.</p>

<h3>
	Preamble
</h3>
    <p>Right now the site is basically an experiment with HTML and CSS. I've done some stuff with the <a href="https://openpotd.github.io/">OpenPOTD</a> website, which motivated me to do some stuff on this site which had been lying dormant for a while (oops!). Even so, expect the site to be very spartan.</p>
<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>Here are some pages to direct you to stuff that might either interest you, or you might be looking for:</p>
